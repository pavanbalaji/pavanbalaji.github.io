## About Me

I hold appointments as a Senior computer Scientist and Group Lead at
the Argonne National Laboratory and as an Institute Fellow of the
Northwestern-Argonne Institute of Science and Engineering at
Northwestern University.

Over the course of my tenure at Argonne, I have handled a number of
responsibilities.

In a technical role, I have contributed to the design and software
implementation of a number of projects on communication runtime
systems (MPI, UCX), threading models (lightweight threads such as
Argobots, OpenMP), and heterogeneous memory systems.  Particularly
noteworthy are the [MPICH project](http://www.mpich.org) (used by
thousands of supercomputers around the world, including the three
upcoming US Exascale supercomputers --- Aurora, Frontier, and El
Capitan), the [UCX project](https://www.openucx.org) (R&D100 award
winner in 2019), and the [Argobots project](https://www.argobots.org)
(R&D100 award finalist in 2020, and a driving piece of software for
numerous supercomputers and commercial products such as Intel DAOS).

In a leadership role, I have lead two groups. The first group focused
on Programming Models and Runtime Systems and mainly covering areas
related to communication runtime systems, threading models,
accelerator models, big data and cloud computing systems, and other
related technologies.  The second group focused on Future
Architectures for AI and mainly covered technologies related to AI,
machine learning and deep learning, particularly in the area of AI for
science.

I have held several other leadership roles in the community serving on
the board of directors or advisory board for numerous domestic and
International projects, including UCX (US), Cilkplus (US), EPEEC
(Europe), Exascale Technologies (China), and various others.  I have
also served as a general or technical program chair or editor for
numerous high-profile conferences and journals including IEEE/ACM SC
in 2019 (technical program chair), IEEE Cluster in 2015 (general
co-chair), IEEE/ACM CCGrid in 2015 (general co-chair), and so on. I
play a prominent role in advising Argonne's computing facility on the
programming models aspects of the various upcoming supercomputers,
including Aurora, which is expected to be the first US Exascale
supercomputer.


## Job Opportunities

My group has a number of openings for research internship,
[predoctoral (post-masters) researcher
positions](https://careers.peopleclick.com/careerscp/client_argonnelab/external/gateway.do?functionName=viewFromLink&jobPostId=9387&localeCode=en-us),
and [postdoctoral researcher
positions](https://careers.peopleclick.com/careerscp/client_argonnelab/post_doc/gateway.do?functionName=viewFromLink&jobPostId=9389&localeCode=en-us).
There is no US citizenship or greencard requirement for any of these
positions.  Short-term positions are completely virtual and do not
require candidates to relocate.  Long-term positions would start off
in virtual mode and would eventually (at a date to be decided later)
need relocation to Chicago.  Relocation costs would be covered by
Argonne.  We are looking for candidates who can start in these
positions relatively soon.

Candidates in all positions would be expected to perform research in
optimizing communication runtime systems and threading systems for
large distributed computing platforms.  The successful candidate will
work as part of a multidisciplinary research team involving computer
and computational scientists, physicists, and mathematicians to enable
data analysis of simulations and experiments running on some of the
world's largest supercomputers including US's first exascale
supercomputer, "Aurora," to be deployed in 2021.

Programming experience with C/C++ is required.  Experience with high
performance computing systems, parallel programming models (MPI,
OpenMP, PGAS or equivalent) or accelerator models (e.g., GPUs) is
preferred.

Please contact me by email or on LinkedIn with any queries that you
might have.
