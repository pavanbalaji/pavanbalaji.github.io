## About Me

I am an Applied Research Scientist, Technical Lead, and Manager at
Facebook where I lead the HPC Network Communications and Early
Industry Partnerships Group.  Before joining Facebook, I used to hold
appointments as a Senior computer Scientist and Group Lead at the
Argonne National Laboratory and as an Institute Fellow of the
Northwestern-Argonne Institute of Science and Engineering at
Northwestern University.

At Facebook, I contribute to the AI hardware/software codesign aspects
of the Facebook ecosystem in a pathfinding research role.  I am
responsible for two broad areas: (1) codesigning our AI application
requirements for communication, network, and scale-up/scale-out with
various hardware and software solutions (both external or homegrown);
and (2) influencing and codesigning vendor architecture and software
roadmaps to align with Facebook's long-term workload requirements.

In my previous job at Argonne, I have lead two groups. The first group
focused on Programming Models and Runtime Systems and mainly covering
areas related to communication runtime systems, threading models,
accelerator models, big data and cloud computing systems, and other
related technologies.  The second group focused on Future
Architectures for AI and mainly covered technologies related to AI,
machine learning and deep learning, particularly in the area of AI for
science.  I also contributed to the design and software implementation
of a number of projects on communication runtime systems (MPI, UCX),
threading models (lightweight threads such as Argobots, OpenMP), and
heterogeneous memory systems.  Particularly noteworthy are the [MPICH
project](http://www.mpich.org) (used by thousands of supercomputers
around the world, including the three upcoming US Exascale
supercomputers --- Aurora, Frontier, and El Capitan), the [UCX
project](https://www.openucx.org) (R&D100 award winner in 2019), and
the [Argobots project](https://www.argobots.org) (R&D100 award
finalist in 2020, and a driving piece of software for numerous
supercomputers and commercial products such as Intel DAOS).

I have held several other leadership roles in the community serving on
the board of directors or advisory board for numerous domestic and
International projects, including UCX (US), Cilkplus (US), EPEEC
(Europe), Exascale Technologies (China), and various others.  I have
also served as a general or technical program chair or editor for
numerous high-profile conferences and journals including IEEE/ACM SC
in 2019 (technical program chair), IEEE Cluster in 2015 (general
co-chair), IEEE/ACM CCGrid in 2015 (general co-chair), and so on.  I
also served as an advisor for Argonne's computing facility on the
programming models aspects of the various upcoming supercomputers,
including Aurora, which is expected to be one of the first US Exascale
supercomputers.
